# 1.2.13.0

## Fixed
- GacUI Unit Test detects if a frame in `OnNextIdleFrame` does nothing to the UI or calls a blocking function, leading to a failure test case.

## New Feature
- `InjectFileSystemImpl` to replace implementation for `FileStream`, `FilePath`, `File`, `Folder`.
- `[SPACE]` key in `GuiVirtualTextList` will check or uncheck selected items.

## Milestone

- Copilot
  - A systemetical way to analysis code and prepare interface and implementation document allowing micro management
    - Propose documenta and write to knowledge base
    - The knowledge base will be shared to the website
- Unit Test Snapshot Viewer
  - Show dom nodes in a tree view in the right side of the rendering tab optionally.
  - Select dom node and jump to other tabs with highlight.
- Remote Protocol: Add window resizing constraint messages.
  - Fix `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`.
  - Fix GacJS.
  - Resizing should also send message so the UI could update layout and repaint.
  - Bug: in hosted mode, when dragging left/top border of the main window, the window move if the size is smaller than the minimum size.
- Unit Test: Check all control key operation, ensure accessibility.
  - `GuiDateComboBox` does not receive focus properly, so that when open year/month combo by `ALT` or mouse, list item cannot be selected only by key.
    - Add `Alt` and fix `Mouse` test cases after this is fixed.
- Document
  - Since document from `copilot-instructions.md` will be removed and put into knowledge base, update them in any README.md and website.

## Depriorized

- `GuiRemoteController` Reconnecting
  - Test sending disconnect or other events when `Submit()` is pending on the event.
    - Especially during the first connection, it is observed in GacJS that when it is the first renderer and failed during connection ballbacks, Core can't respond to other renderers again.
  - Support failure injection in unit test, making `UnitTestRemoteProtocol::Submit()` returns `true` to its `disconnected` parameter.
- Unit Test: Check all control key operation, ensure accessibility. (has workaround)
  - Cannot scroll `GuiScrollView`, key operations needed and also need to be disabled for `GuiListControl` because it has already defined item selection keys.
  - Active top level menus (in a menu bar) without `Alt` property assigned.
    - Investigate about menu bar accepting tab actions. It appears on Windows tab menu buttons could have focus.
    - When a menu bar is activated by `[TAB]`, keep pressing `[TAB]` will go through all menu buttons and pass it to the next control after ending.
    - When a menu is activated by `[TAB]`, keep pressing `[TAB]` will go through all menu buttons and repeat, until `[ESC]`.
    - `[SPACE]` or `[ENTER]` selects a highlighted menu button when tabbing.
  - `GuiVirtualListView` cannot operate column headers by key.
