# 1.2.13.0

## Milestone

- UnitTest
  - Add a `/C` mode just for copilot, it prints the first error/exception/runtime error, and then exit.
    - `/D` won't print and `/R` won't stop
  - Snapshot init test should crash after 100 frames of no visual changing instead of running forever.
- Copilot
  - `0-scrum.prompt.md`, log my high-level idea to `Copilot_Scrum.md` and break it into different tasks.
    - Tasks should be organized by `Phrase/Task`, make it easy to be marked as `Executing` or `Finished` by other scripts, so `1-design.prompt.md` can pick the next one.
    - `Copilot_Scrum.md` should check in, unlike other temporary documents.
    - Multiple rounds of re-design is usually needed so this file will not be clean up by `copilotPrepare.ps1`, I will manually clean it up after everything is done.
    - Keep updating/summarizing new findings of project specific knowledge in another checked in file.
      - In `Copilot-Scrum.md` it needs to say whether a guideline is found to support a decision or not.
      - Also suggests if anything needs to be added yo the guideline.
  - `5-learning.prompt.md`: Add something to knowledge base, detech what is affected by the change to keep it up to date.
    - It will reads all 3 document files to make a decision.
  - Finish knowledge base
- `GuiRemoteController`
  - Reconnecting
    - Test sending disconnect or other events when `Submit()` is pending on the event.
    - Support failure injection in unit test, making `UnitTestRemoteProtocol::Submit()` returns `true` to its `disconnected` parameter.
- Unit Test Snapshot Viewer
  - Show dom nodes in a tree view in the right side of the rendering tab optionally.
  - Select dom node and jump to other tabs with highlight.
- All control unit test (using DarkSkin)
  - Dialogs.
  - A mechanism to replace `vl::filesystem` implementation.
    - Complete file dialog tests after that.
  - Add window resizing constraint messages.
    - Fix `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`.
    - Fix GacJS.
    - Resizing should also send message so the UI could update layout and repaint.
  - Check all control key operation, ensure accessibility.
    - Cannot scroll `GuiScrollView`, key operations needed and also need to be disabled for `GuiListControl` because it has already defined item selection keys.
    - `Gui(Bindable)TextList` cannot check or uncheck items by key (enter and space).
    - `GuiVirtualListView` cannot operate column headers by key.
    - Active menus without `Alt` assighed (`TAB` and arrow keys?).
    - `GuiDateComboBox` does not receive focus property, so that when open year/month combo by `ALT` or mouse, list item cannot be selected only by key.
      - Add `Alt` and fix `Mouse` test cases after this is fixed.
- Document
  - Since document from `copilot-instructions.md` will be removed and put into knowledge base, update them in any README.md and website.
