# 1.2.13.0

## Fixed
- GacUI Unit Test detects if a frame in `OnNextIdleFrame` does nothing to the UI or calls a blocking function, leading to a failure test case.
- `GuiDatePicker` should tab through days by rows.
- `GuiComboBoxBase` handles `[ESC]` to close the combo.
- Menu didn't close immediately if the handler is blocked
- `GuiDateComboBox` did not receive focus properly, when opening year/month combo by `ALT` or mouse, list item cannot be selected only by key.
- In hosted mode, when dragging left/top border of the main window, the window move if the size is smaller than the minimum size.

## New Feature
- `InjectFileSystemImpl` to replace implementation for `FileStream`, `FilePath`, `File`, `Folder`.
- `[SPACE]` key in `GuiVirtualTextList` will check or uncheck selected items.
- `GacUI.UnitTest.UI.(h|cpp)` allows you to click an UI element to jump to the DOM tree in the tree view, or reversely.

## Milestone

- Copilot
  - A systematical way to analysis code and prepare interface and implementation document allowing micro management
