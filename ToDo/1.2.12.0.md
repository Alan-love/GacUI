# 1.2.12.0

## Milestone

- GacUI
  - In async channel, make debug asserts to ensure expected functions are actually called on dedicated (UI/Channel) threads.
  - `<RawRendering/>` element.
    - In HTML, it would open a `<div/>` and you can do whatever you want using JavaScript.
- JavaScript rendering:
  - A codegen for remote protocol and print TypeScript code.
  - JavaScript side will separate the rendering and the network protocol, `RemotingTest_Core` for server side.
  - Implement renderer with DOM.
  - Try EsBuild to replace WebPack.

## Release

- Ensure build workflow tutorials.
- Update Win11 menu tutorial in `Release` repo to use new virtual control: `ToolstripToolBarInMenu`, `ToolstripSplitterInMenu`

## Further Experiments

- Canvas instead of DOM.
  - https://github.com/WICG/canvas-formatted-text/blob/main/README.md
  - layout provider could not be done until this is implemented.
