# 1.2.12.0

## Milestone

- GacUI
  - `GuiRemoteProtocolAsyncChannelSerializerBase::FetchAndExecuteTasks` sometimes fetched tasks with `0xDDDD...`, what has been destructed?
  - Remove `IGuiRemoteProtocolChannel::ProcessRemoteEvents` and `IGuiRemoteProtocol::ProcessRemoteEvents`
    - Change it to `GetRemoteEventProcessor`, returning an interface that has `ProcessRemoteEvents`.
    - `IGuiRemoteProtocolChannel` and `IGuiRemoteProtocol` can share the same interface.
    - Since `ProcessRemoteEvents` are redirecting most of the time, only when the deepest one needs it, combinators outside have it.
    - Some `ProcessRemoteEvents` implementations are empty, some are `CHECK_FAIL`, they can just not exist.

- Fix License about GacJS, treat it as a release repo.

## Release

- Ensure build workflow tutorials.
- Update Win11 menu tutorial in `Release` repo to use new virtual control: `ToolstripToolBarInMenu`, `ToolstripSplitterInMenu`

## Further Experiments

- Canvas instead of DOM.
  - https://github.com/WICG/canvas-formatted-text/blob/main/README.md
  - layout provider could not be done until this is implemented.
