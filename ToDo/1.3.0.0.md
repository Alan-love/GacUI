# 1.3.0.0

## Milestone

- `GuiDocumentViewer` and `GuiDocumentLabel`
  - In the constructor a struct of configration is required, and it will not be changed after the control is created:
    - `AllowScrollBars`
      - It must be false for `GuiDocumentLabel`, which means it will be ignored.
      - When it is true, display scroll bars accordingly.
      - When it is false, content automatically scrolls with cursor changing by user input. When `Paragraph` is `Singleline`, the height is fixed.
  - `PasteAsPlainText`
  - `PasswordChar`, set to `\0` to disable 
  - `WrapLine`
    - `IGuiGraphicsParagraph` already allow line wrapping, it is time to test!
  - `ParagraphMode`
    - `Singleline`: only one paragraph is allowed, only one line is allowed in the first paragraph.
    - `Multiline`: only one line is allowed in each paragraph.
    - `Paragraph`: no limitation.
    - When the document is assigned directly, lines or paragraphs could be joined into one single line according to this property.
    - For `Multiline` paragraphs are parsed/joined with one CrLf. Meanwhile `Paragraph` is one between lines and two between paragraphs.
  - `ParagraphPadding`
- `GuiDocumentLabel` always expands to display all contents, while `GuiDocumentViewer` just clips.
- Predefined settings:
  - DocumentBox/DocumentLabel: AllowScrollBars(false), PasteAsPlainText(false), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(true), ParagraphMode(Paragraph), ParagraphPadding(5).
  - DocumentViewer: AllowScrollBars(true), PasteAsPlainText(false), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(true), ParagraphMode(Paragrapg), ParagraphPadding(5).
  - SinglelineTextBox: AllowScrollBars(false), PasteAsPlainText(true), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(false), ParagraphMode(Singleline), ParagraphPadding(0).
  - MultilineTextBox: AllowScrollBars(true), PasteAsPlainText(true), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(false), ParagraphMode(Multiline), ParagraphPadding(0).
  - SinglineTextBox and MultilineTextBox are both DocumentViewer.
- Remove dependency to `VlppParser`.
- Delete `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`.
- Delete `GuiColorizedTextElement`.

## Depriorized

- `GuiRemoteController` Reconnecting
  - Test sending disconnect or other events when `Submit()` is pending on the event.
    - Especially during the first connection, it is observed in GacJS that when it is the first renderer and failed during connection ballbacks, Core can't respond to other renderers again.
  - Support failure injection in unit test, making `UnitTestRemoteProtocol::Submit()` returns `true` to its `disconnected` parameter.
- Unit Test: Check all control key operation, ensure accessibility. (has workaround)
  - Cannot scroll `GuiScrollView`, key operations needed and also need to be disabled for `GuiListControl` because it has already defined item selection keys.
  - Active top level menus (in a menu bar) without `Alt` property assigned.
    - Investigate about menu bar accepting tab actions. It appears on Windows tab menu buttons could have focus.
    - When a menu bar is activated by `[TAB]`, keep pressing `[TAB]` will go through all menu buttons and pass it to the next control after ending.
    - When a menu is activated by `[TAB]`, keep pressing `[TAB]` will go through all menu buttons and repeat, until `[ESC]`.
    - `[SPACE]` or `[ENTER]` selects a highlighted menu button when tabbing.
  - `GuiVirtualListView` cannot operate column headers by key.
