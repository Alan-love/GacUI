# 1.3.0.0

## Fixed
- `DocumentModel::SaveToXml` double space characters.
- `IGuiGraphicsParagraph` rendering and caret calculation bugs on GDI.

## Breaking Changes
- Delete `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`.
  - A new `GuiSinglelineTextBox` will be created, inheriting from `GuiDocumentLabel`.
  - A new `GuiMultilineTextBox` will be created, inheriting from `GuiDocumentViewer`.

## New Features
- `GuiDocumentCommonInterface` sub classes accept `GuiDocumentConfig` to control document editing and rendering behavior.
- `GuiDocumentCommonInterface` offer `ConvertToPlainText` and `LoadTextAndClearUndoRedo`/`LoadDocumentAndClearUndoRedo`
- Add `PasswordChar` to `GuiDocumentCommonInterface`, set to `\0` to disable.

## Known Issues

- `GuiDocumentViewer` loading super large text into one single paragraph (~0.2M lines) too slow
  - Demo: `https://github.com/vczh-libraries/GacUI/blob/master/Test/Resources/UnitTestSnapshots/Controls/Ribbon/GuiRibbonButtons/Dropdowns.json`
  - **Paragraph mode** plus **doubleLineBreaksBetweenParagraph==true** plus **no empty line** causing the whole text loaded into one single `IGuiGraphicsParagraph`.
    - This is the default configuration for `GuiDocumentViewer` and `GuiDocumentLabel`, it could be changed with the `Behavior` property in XML.
  - Root cause in `IDWriteTextLayout::GetMetrics`, taking most of the time.
  - When loading super big content to the control while you don't need user to undo to the previous state:
    - To load such text into `GuiMultilineTextBox` uses `LoadTextAndClearUndoRedo`.
    - To load prepared large document into `GuiDocumentViewer` uses `LoadDocumentAndClearUndoRedo`.
    - Future editing still work with undo.

## Copilot

- `kb-design.prompt.md`:
  - Adding a new control
  - UI Operations:
    - Tab, Alt
    - Event Propagation
  - Menu interaction between owner and sub item
  - List control architecture
    - Layout
    - Virtual item management
    - Tree item management
  - XML Compiler topics ...

## Known Issues

- UnitTestSnapshotViewer
  - It becomes slow when loading a large test case like `Test\Resources\UnitTestSnapshots\Controls\Ribbon\GuiRibbonButtons\Dropdowns.json`.
  - `UnitTestSnapshotFileNode::EnsureLoaded`, `JsonParse` takes too much time.
- FileDialog
  - No file showing if filtered, see `CppTest` for insert image dialog.

## Milestone

- Make a general framework for `InjectXXXImpl` and `IXXXImpl`, so that each injected implementation could access the previous implementation, and ensured ejection in order. An ejection could happen in any level so that all dependents are ejected.
- `GuiDocumentElementRenderer`
  - Add a new option `paragraphRecycle`, when it is true, a `IGuiGraphicsParagraph` outside of the view will be released, keeping only the last height.
    - This option will be enabled by default.
- `GuiDocumentCommonInterface` testability
  - Make `UserInput_` methods public static and run unit test.
- Document
  - `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`
    - `Select` -> `SetCaret`
    - `Readonly` -> `EditMode`
  - `GuiDocumentCommonInterface::LoadTextAndClearUndoRedo`
  - `GuiDocumentCommonInterface::LoadDocumentAndClearUndoRedo`
