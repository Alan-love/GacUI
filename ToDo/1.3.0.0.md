# 1.3.0.0

## Fixed
- `DocumentModel::SaveToXml` double space characters.
- `IGuiGraphicsParagraph` rendering and caret calculation bugs on GDI.

## Breaking Changes
- Delete `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`.
  - A new `GuiSinglelineTextBox` will be created, inheriting from `GuiDocumentLabel`.
  - A new `GuiMultilineTextBox` will be created, inheriting from `GuiDocumentViewer`.

## New Features
- `GuiDocumentLabel` and `GuiDocumentViewer` accept `GuiDocumentConfig` to control document editing and rendering behavior.
- `GuiDocumentLabel` and `GuiDocumentViewer` offer `ConvertToPlainText`.
- Add `PasswordChar` to `GuiDocumentCommonInterface`, set to `\0` to disable.

## Copilot

- `kb-design.prompt.md`:
  - Adding a new control
  - UI Operations:
    - Tab, Alt
    - Event Propagation
  - Menu interaction between owner and sub item
  - List control architecture
    - Layout
    - Virtual item management
    - Tree item management
  - XML Compiler topics ...

## Milestone

- UnitTestViewer
  - When the UI is complex, loading the virtual DOM tree seems slow.
  - The loading must be fast, it is fine to wait for a while to make element tree ready.
  - Debug performance is bad, most of release cases are fast, some needs 1 second to load.
- Document
  - `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`
    - `Select` -> `SetCaret`
    - `Readonly` -> `EditMode`
