# 1.3.0.0

## Milestone

- `GuiDocumentViewer` and `GuiDocumentLabel`:
  - Paragraph mode: default and work like current.
  - Multiline mode: each paragraph is a line, line padding shrinks, no line wrapping, multiple lines are forbidden in one paragraph (auto concatenate), incoming document will be modified before inserting. `GetText()` use one `CRLF` between paragraphs.
  - Singleline mode: similar to multiline mode but paragraphs from the second will all be discarded.
  - In non-paragraph mode:
    - `GuiDocumentViewer` displays two scroll bars accordingly.
    - `GuiDocumentLabel` auto expands horizontally according to content, no extra line wrapping option for non-paragraph mode.
    - `<DocumentTextBox/>` needs to adjust horizontal offset according to cursor.
      - It is also a `GuiDocumentLabel`, need further consideration, do we need a new control instead of just a skin?
- Implement `ColorizedTextElement` and `DocumentElement` in all already implemented remote renderers.
  - Allow renderer and core in different unicode encoding.
