# 1.3.0.0

## Fixed
- `DocumentModel::SaveToXml` double space characters.
- `IGuiGraphicsParagraph` rendering and caret calculation bugs on GDI.
- `FakeDialogServiceBase` renders and selects wront files if filter applied.

## Breaking Changes
- Delete `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`.
  - A new `GuiSinglelineTextBox` will be created, inheriting from `GuiDocumentLabel`.
  - A new `GuiMultilineTextBox` will be created, inheriting from `GuiDocumentViewer`.

## New Features
- `GuiDocumentCommonInterface` sub classes accept `GuiDocumentConfig` to control document editing and rendering behavior.
- `GuiDocumentCommonInterface` offer `ConvertToPlainText` and `LoadTextAndClearUndoRedo`/`LoadDocumentAndClearUndoRedo`
- Add `PasswordChar` to `GuiDocumentCommonInterface`, set to `\0` to disable.

## Known Issues

- `GuiDocumentViewer` loading super large text into one single paragraph (~0.2M lines) too slow
  - Demo: `https://github.com/vczh-libraries/GacUI/blob/master/Test/Resources/UnitTestSnapshots/Controls/Ribbon/GuiRibbonButtons/Dropdowns.json`
  - **Paragraph mode** plus **doubleLineBreaksBetweenParagraph==true** plus **no empty line** causing the whole text loaded into one single `IGuiGraphicsParagraph`.
    - This is the default configuration for `GuiDocumentViewer` and `GuiDocumentLabel`, it could be changed with the `Behavior` property in XML.
  - Root cause in `IDWriteTextLayout::GetMetrics`, taking most of the time.
  - When loading super big content to the control while you don't need user to undo to the previous state:
    - To load such text into `GuiMultilineTextBox` uses `LoadTextAndClearUndoRedo`.
    - To load prepared large document into `GuiDocumentViewer` uses `LoadDocumentAndClearUndoRedo`.
    - Future editing still work with undo.

## Known Issues

- UnitTestSnapshotViewer
  - It becomes slow when loading a large test case like `Test\Resources\UnitTestSnapshots\Controls\Ribbon\GuiRibbonButtons\Dropdowns.json`.
  - `UnitTestSnapshotFileNode::EnsureLoaded`, `JsonParse` takes too much time.
- `indexed(FromArray(xs))` crashes, because the enumerable created by `FromArray` is released before for-loop calling `begin`.
  - `indexed` takes a const reference might be the cause.
  - Consider making a version for right-value reference.
- GacUI_Controls/GlobalHotKey tutorial: pressing hot key doesn't work.
- GacUI_Controls/ProgressAndAsync tutorial: doesn't scroll to the top after downloading.

## Milestone

- `GuiDocumentElementRenderer`
  - Add a new option `paragraphRecycle`, when it is true, a `IGuiGraphicsParagraph` outside of the view will be released, keeping only the last height.
    - This option will be enabled by default.
- Is it possible to print memory leaks directly to the screen when running unit test with `/C`?
  - In case when it is too many, we can clip it at the first 100 lines.
- Document
  - `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`
    - `Select` -> `SetCaret`
    - `Readonly` -> `EditMode`
  - `GuiDocumentCommonInterface::LoadTextAndClearUndoRedo`
  - `GuiDocumentCommonInterface::LoadDocumentAndClearUndoRedo`
  - `InjectDateTimeImpl` and `EjectDateTimeImpl`. Now `InjectDateTimeImpl(nullptr)` is illegal, use `EjectDateTimeImpl(nullptr)` to cancel all injection.
    - Same for locale and filesystem.
