# 1.2.11.0

## Completed

- Fixed:
  - `GuiWindow::GuiWindow` calling `SetNativeWindow` skips all sub classes' `AfterControlTemplateInstalled_` calling because at the moment sub classes are not fully initialized yet.
  - Displaying a tooltip and exit would crash on deleting `sharedTooltipControl` in `GuiApplication::~GuiApplication`.
  - Toolstrip dropdown button has unwanted splitter in control template.
  - `<Raw/>` element in GacUI XML mappaing to raw element for each renderer.

## Milestone

- Document if not exist
  - `<RibbonToolstripMenu/>`
  - `<RibbonGallery/>`
  - `<BindableRibbonGalleryList/>`
  - `<RibbonToolstripHeader/>`
  - `vl::InjectLocaleImpl`
  - Add a section on the website for `copilot-instruction.md` references. Mention it in each repo and summerizes in `Release` repo.
