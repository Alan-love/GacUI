# 1.2.11.0

## Completed

- Fixed:
  - `GuiWindow::GuiWindow` calling `SetNativeWindow` skips all sub classes' `AfterControlTemplateInstalled_` calling because at the moment sub classes are not fully initialized yet.
  - Displaying a tooltip and exit would crash on deleting `sharedTooltipControl` in `GuiApplication::~GuiApplication`.
  - Toolstrip dropdown button has unwanted splitter in control template.

## Milestone

- GacUI
  - `<RawRendering/>` element.
    - It will be mapped to `GDIElement` or `Direct2DElement` in different renderers.
    - In remote protocol, it is an element with no extra properties.
    - Consider about accessing it in remote protocol renderer, in core `ref.Name` is enough.
- Unit Test Snapshot Viewer
  - Show dom nodes in a tree view in the right side of the rendering tab optionally.
  - Select dom node and jump to other tabs with highlight.
- `GuiRemoteController`
  - Reconnecting
    - Test sending disconnect or other events when `Submit()` is pending on the event.
    - Support failure injection in unit test, making `UnitTestRemoteProtocol::Submit()` returns `true` to its `disconnected` parameter.
- `GacUI_Remoting_Tests\*`
  - HttpServer
    - Allow disconnect and reconnect.
      - `/Connect` can be called multiple time to generatebdifferent GUID
      - Cancel current pending `/Request` 
      - Disconnect core immediately following by a connect from new client
      - Register wildcard for `/Request` and `/Respond`, if the GUID does not match returns 404
      - Test it by starting another renderer or calling connect in a browser
    - When TypeScript rendering is completed, the demo in `Release` repo would become a website server.
  - HttpClient
    - `RendererChannel::OnReceive` try to call `SendStringArray`, if a response is pending, all events will be waiting and collected into an array, the last item will be the response.
      - We may need to add `ChannelPackageSemantic` to callbacks instead of using the `ChannelPackageSemanticUnpack` approach.
      - Turn the argument to `{semantic, id, string}`.
- Document if not exist
  - `<RibbonToolstripMenu/>`
  - `<RibbonGallery/>`
  - `<BindableRibbonGalleryList/>`
  - `<RibbonToolstripHeader/>`
  - `vl::InjectLocaleImpl`
