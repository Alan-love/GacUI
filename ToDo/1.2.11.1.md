# 1.2.11.0

## Completed

- Fixed:
  - `GuiWindow::GuiWindow` calling `SetNativeWindow` skips all sub classes' `AfterControlTemplateInstalled_` calling because at the moment sub classes are not fully initialized yet.
  - Displaying a tooltip and exit would crash on deleting `sharedTooltipControl` in `GuiApplication::~GuiApplication`.
  - Toolstrip dropdown button has unwanted splitter in control template.
  - `<Raw/>` element in GacUI XML mappaing to raw element for each renderer.
