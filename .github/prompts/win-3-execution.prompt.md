# Execution

- Checkout `Accessing Log Files and PowerShell Scripts` for context about mentioned `*.md` and `*.ps1` files.
  - All `*.md` and `*.ps1` files should already be existing, you should not create any new files.

## Goal and Constraints

- Your goal is to finish an execution document in `Copilot_Execution.md` according to `Copilot_Task.md` and `Copilot_Planning.md`.
- You are also going to apply changes on the source code as well following `Copilot_Execution.md`.

## Copilot_Planning.md Structure

- `# !!!EXECUTION!!!`: This file always begin with this title.
- `# UPDATES`: An exact copy of the problem description I gave you.
  - `## UPDATE`: There could be multiple occurrences. Each one has an exact copy of the update description I gave you.
- `# IMPROVEMENT PLAN`.
- `# TEST PLAN`.
- `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.

## Step 1. Identify the Problem

- The design document is in `Copilot_Task.md`, the planning document is in `Copilot_Planning.md`.
- Find `# Update` in the LATEST chat message. Ignore any `# Update` in the chat history.
- If there is an `# Update` section: it means I am going to propose some change to `Copilot_Execution.md` and the source code together.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Update` from the LATEST chat message to the `# UPDATES` section, with a new sub-section `## UPDATE`.
  - Follow my update to change the execution document and the source code.
- If there is nothing:
  - If `Copilot_Execution.md` only has a title, you are on a fresh start.
  - If there is a `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark in `Copilot_Execution.md`, it means you are accidentally stopped while changing the source code. Please continue your work.
  - If there is no `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark in `Copilot_Execution.md`, it means you are accidentally stopped while finishing the document. Please continue your work.

## Step 2. Finish the Document

- Your need to summary code change in `Copilot_Execution.md`.
- All changes you need to made is already in `Copilot_Planning.md`, but it contains many explanations.
- Read `Copilot_Planning.md`, copy the following parts to `Copilot_Execution.md`:
  - `# IMPROVEMENT PLAN`
    - Only include actual code changes. Do not include any explanations or comments around them.
  - `# TEST PLAN`
    - Only include actual code changes. Do not include any explanations or comments around them.
- DO NOT copy `# UPDATES` from `Copilot_Planning.md` to `Copilot_Execution.md`. The `# UPDATES` in `Copilot_Execution.md` is for update requests for `Copilot_Execution.md` and the actual source code.

## Step 3. Mark the Completion

- Ensure there is a `# !!!FINISHED!!!` mark at the end of `Copilot_Execution.md` to indicate the document reaches the end.

## Step 4. Finish the Source Code

- Apply all instructions in `Copilot_Execution.md` to the source code.

## Step 5. Make Sure the Code Compiles but DO NOT Run Unit Test

- Check out `Compile the Solution` for details about compiling the solution but DO NOT run unit test. If there is any compilation error, address all of them:
  - If there is any compile warning, only fix warnings that caused by your code change. Do no fix any other warnings.
  - If there is any compile error, you need to carefully identify, is the issue in the callee side or the caller side. Check out similar code before making a decision.
  - For every attempt of fixing the source code:
    - Explain why the original change did not work.
    - Explain what you need to do.
    - Explain why you think it would solve the build break.
    - Log these in `Copilot_Execution.md`, with section `## Fixing attempt No.<attempt_number>` in `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.
  - Go back to `Step 5. Make Sure the Code Compiles`
- When the code compiles:
  - DO NOT run any tests, the code will be verified in future tasks.

# General Instruction

- You are on Windows running in Visual Studio Code.
- When you need to run any powershell script mentioned in the instruction, please remember to use the `&` operator like this:
  - `X.ps1`: invalid command.
  - `..\X.ps1`: valid command but it doesn't work with you.
  - `& X.ps1` or `& ..\X.ps1`: good.
  
- Before saying anything, say "Yes, vczh!". I use it to make sure instruction files are taking effect.
- Find out the `Accessing Knowledge Base` section, read `Index.md` of `KnowledgeBase` project in the current solution.
- Before generating any code, if the file is changed, read it. Not all changes come from you, I will edit the file too. Do not generate code based on out-dated version in your memory.
- If you found I have edited the code you are working on, I have my purpose, take my change and do your work based on it.
- When looking for any file mentioned, always look for them in the solution.
  - If you find them not existing, read the solution file to search for the entry, there will be a relative file path.
- When adding a source file to a project:
  - It must belong to a project, which is a `*.vcxproj` or `*.vcxitems` file.
  - It is an XML file.
  - Edit that project file to include the source file.
- When adding a source file to a specific solution explorer folder:
  - It must belong to a project, which is a `*.vcxproj` or `*.vcxitems` file.
  - Find the `*.filters` file with the same name, it is an XML file.
  - Each file is attached to a solution explorer folder, described in this XPath: `/Project/ItemGroup/ClCompile@Include="PhysicalFile"/Filter`.
  - In side the `Filter` tag there is the solution explorer folder.
  - Edit that `*.filters` file to include the source file.

# Accessing Log Files and PowerShell Scripts

This guidance is for accessing following files mentioned in this instruction:
- `Copilot_Scrum.md`
- `Copilot_Task.md`
- `Copilot_Planning.md`
- `Copilot_Execution.md`
- `Copilot_KB.md`
- `copilotExecute.ps1`
- `copilotPrepare.ps1`

If you are running in Visual Studio, you will find the `TaskLogs` project in the current solution.
Otherwise, locate the `TaskLogs` project in `REPO-ROOT/.github/TaskLogs/TaskLogs.vcxitems`.
`REPO-ROOT` is the root folder of the repo.

`TaskLogs.vcxitems` is a Visual Studio project file, it is used as a list of all log files and powershell script files, which will be used in this instruction.
You need to locate listed files in `TaskLogs.vcxitems`.

## Important Rules for Markdown Document or Log

- Do not print "````````" or "````````markdown" in markdown file.
- It is totally fine to have multiple top level `# Topic`.
- When mentioning a C++ name in markdown file:
  - If it is defined in the standard C++ library or third-party library, use the full name.
  - If it is defined in the source code, use the full name if there is ambiguity, and then mention the file containing its definition.

# Unit Test Projects to Work with

- `UnitTest`

## Calling copilotBuild.ps1 and copilotExecute.ps1

This solution is in `Test\GacUISrc`, after `ls` to this folder, scripts will be accessible with:
- `& ..\..\.github\TaskLogs\copilotBuild.ps1`
  - Check out `Compile the Solution` for usage of this script.
- `& ..\..\.github\TaskLogs\copilotExecute.ps1 -Executable <The-Test-Project-Name>`. 
  - Check out `Executing Unit Test` for usage of this script.

## Compile the Solution

- Just let Visual Studio Code to compile the solution.
- If Visual Studio Code is not well configured, you must warn me in chat with BIG BOLD TEXT and stop immediately.
- DO NOT use msbuild by yourself.

## Executing Unit Test

- Just let Visual Studio Code to run the unit test.
- If Visual Studio Code is not well configured, you must warn me in chat with BIG BOLD TEXT and stop immediately.
- DO NOT call executables or scripts yourself.
