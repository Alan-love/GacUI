# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

## TASK No.7: Test hierarchical binding scenarios for TreeViewItemBindableRootProvider

This task focuses on testing complex hierarchical scenarios with multi-level data structures, dynamic structure changes, and callback coordination across tree levels.

### what to be done

- Continue expanding `TestItemProviders_TreeViewItemBindableRootProvider.cpp` with hierarchical binding scenario test cases
- Each test case must create its own callbackLog and callback objects for isolation and robustness
- Clear callback logs after SetItemSource calls (except when testing SetItemSource behavior itself)
- Test multi-level ObservableList changes and their callback propagation through tree hierarchy
- Test childrenProperty modifications and their impact on tree structure at various levels
- Test expansion state coordination when underlying data structure changes dynamically
- Test parent item property changes affecting child node visibility/structure
- Test callback coordination using only existing callback interfaces across tree levels
- Test manual notification scenarios for hierarchical property changes
- Test RemoveRange operations on hierarchical ObservableList structures
- Skip testing duplicate bindable items in the tree structure (Value objects cannot be reliably detected as duplicates)

### how to test it

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Each test case must create its own callbackLog and MockNodeProviderCallback objects at the beginning
- Clear callback logs after SetItemSource to isolate verification (except when testing SetItemSource itself)

**Hierarchical Binding Scenarios:**
- Test adding items to nested ObservableList at different tree levels and verify callbacks propagate correctly
  - **Important**: Account for eager child preparation - expect actual child counts in callbacks, not zero
- Test removing items from nested ObservableList and verify callback sequences across levels
  - **Important**: Callback parameters will show actual counts before/after removal due to eager preparation
- Test modifying childrenProperty at various tree depths and verify structure updates
  - **Important**: When structure changes, callbacks show actual prepared child counts
- Test parent node expansion when child ObservableList changes dynamically
  - **Important**: Children are already prepared eagerly, so expansion mainly affects visual state
- Test parent item property changes (text, etc.) and verify child nodes remain consistent
- Test multi-level callback coordination - verify proper callback ordering when changes occur at different levels
  - **Important**: All child counts in callbacks reflect eager preparation at each level
- Test manual UpdateBindingProperties at specific tree nodes and verify callbacks
  - **Important**: Expect maintained child counts during unprepare/re-prepare cycles (e.g., `count=2, newCount=2`)
- Test RemoveRange on ObservableList with children and verify hierarchical cleanup callbacks
  - **Important**: Callback parameters reflect actual prepared child counts being removed
- Test nested ObservableList replacement (changing entire childrenProperty collection)
  - **Important**: Callbacks show old count and new count reflecting actual prepared children
- Test expansion state persistence across data structure modifications

### rationale

Hierarchical binding scenarios represent the core complexity of TreeViewItemBindableRootProvider. Separating these tests into a dedicated task allows focused verification of multi-level data binding:
- Multi-level ObservableList coordination is critical for real tree view usage
- Dynamic structure changes need thorough validation to ensure callback propagation works correctly
- Expansion state coordination with data changes is a common source of bugs
- Following established testing philosophy:
  - Focus on callback behavior across tree hierarchy levels
  - Skip duplicate item detection (Value objects cannot be reliably detected - lesson from Task No.3)
  - Test practical scenarios like nested list modifications that reflect real usage
  - Use minimal test infrastructure with existing mock callbacks
  - Each test case creates its own callback objects for isolation (critical lesson from Task No.5)
  - Clear callback logs after SetItemSource for clean verification
  - **Account for eager child preparation in all test expectations** (critical lesson from Task No.6)
  - Callback parameters (`count`, `newCount`) reflect actual prepared child counts at all hierarchy levels
  - Don't assume lazy preparation - the implementation prepares children eagerly
- This task builds upon the core functionality from Task No.6 and prepares for edge case testing in Task No.8
- The eager preparation behavior discovered in Task No.6 is fundamental to understanding hierarchical callback sequences

# INSIGHTS AND REASONING

## Analysis of Existing Test Coverage

After reviewing the existing `TestItemProviders_TreeViewItemBindableRootProvider.cpp` file (664 lines), the following test categories have been completed in Task No.6 (Core Functionality):

1. **AttachCallback** - Basic callback attachment testing
2. **SimpleItemAddition** - Adding children to root item
3. **PropertyBindingSetup** - Property binding with single items and items having children
4. **SetItemSourceOperations** - SetItemSource with various scenarios including multi-level hierarchy
5. **ObservableListIntegration** - ObservableList operations (Add, Remove, Clear) at root level only
6. **ExpansionCollapseOperations** - Node expansion/collapse behavior
7. **NodeLifecycleAndRelationships** - Parent-child relationships and node navigation
8. **UpdateBindingProperties** - UpdateBindingProperties with/without children property changes
9. **InterfaceMethods** - RequestView and GetTextValue interface methods

## Key Insight: Eager Child Preparation

From Task No.6 testing, a critical behavioral pattern was discovered:
- **Children are prepared eagerly, not lazily**
- When `SetItemSource` is called, children are prepared immediately
- When `GetChildCount()` or `GetChild()` is first accessed, children are prepared if not already
- All callbacks reflect **actual prepared child counts**, never zero (unless truly empty)
- This applies to all levels of the hierarchy

Example from existing tests:
```cpp
auto rootItem = CreateBindableTree(L"Root", 3);
provider->SetItemSource(BoxValue(rootItem));
// Expected callback shows: newCount=3 (actual child count)
// NOT newCount=0 (which would indicate lazy preparation)
```

## What's Missing: Hierarchical Binding Scenarios

The existing tests primarily focus on **single-level operations** (root and immediate children). Task No.7 must address **multi-level hierarchical scenarios**:

### 1. Multi-Level ObservableList Modifications
**Gap**: No tests modify ObservableList at level 2 or deeper (grandchildren, great-grandchildren)

**Need**: Test cases that:
- Add items to grandchild ObservableList and verify callback propagation with correct node path
- Remove items from grandchild ObservableList and verify callbacks
- Clear grandchild ObservableList and verify hierarchical cleanup
- Verify that callbacks fire with the correct node context (not root, but the specific grandchild node)

**Example scenario**: 
```
Root
  └─ Child1
      └─ GrandChild1
          └─ GreatGrandChild1  <-- Add/remove items here
```

### 2. Nested Callback Propagation Verification
**Gap**: No verification that callback node paths are correct when changes occur at depth

**Need**: Test cases that verify:
- When adding a great-grandchild, the callback fires with the grandchild node as context
- When removing from level 3, the callback shows the correct parent node path
- Multiple callbacks at different levels show correct ordering and node paths

### 3. Expansion State Coordination with Dynamic Changes
**Gap**: No tests verify expansion state behavior when children are dynamically added/removed while nodes are expanded

**Need**: Test cases that:
- Expand a child node, then add children to that expanded node
- Expand a child node, then remove some of its children
- Expand a child node, then clear all its children
- Verify expansion state is maintained correctly during structure changes

**Example scenario**: Child1 is expanded, then we add GrandChild3 to Child1's children list - verify the expansion state remains and callbacks reflect the addition correctly.

### 4. Nested ObservableList Replacement
**Gap**: No tests replace entire childrenProperty at non-root levels

**Need**: Test cases that:
- Replace Child1's entire children ObservableList with a new one
- Verify callbacks show old count and new count reflecting actual prepared children
- Test replacement at level 2 (replace GrandChild1's children)
- Verify tree navigation still works after replacement

### 5. RemoveRange on Nested Levels
**Gap**: No tests use RemoveRange at level 2 or deeper

**Need**: Test cases that:
- Call RemoveRange on a grandchild's ObservableList
- Verify callback parameters reflect actual prepared child counts being removed
- Test RemoveRange at multiple levels in sequence

### 6. Parent Property Changes Affecting Children
**Gap**: No tests verify that when parent text changes, children remain consistent

**Need**: Test cases that:
- Change a parent item's text property
- Verify children are still accessible and correct
- Verify no unexpected callbacks for children when only parent changes

### 7. Multi-Level UpdateBindingProperties
**Gap**: UpdateBindingProperties tests only verify root-level behavior

**Need**: Test cases that:
- Call UpdateBindingProperties and verify it affects all prepared levels
- Test with multi-level tree structure (3+ levels deep)
- Verify callbacks fire for all levels with correct counts

## Test Organization Strategy

Based on the gaps identified, I propose organizing the hierarchical tests into these categories:

### Category 1: Multi-Level ObservableList Modifications
- `ObservableListAddAtGrandchildLevel` - Add items to grandchild ObservableList
- `ObservableListRemoveAtGrandchildLevel` - Remove items from grandchild ObservableList
- `ObservableListClearAtGrandchildLevel` - Clear grandchild ObservableList
- `ObservableListAddAtGreatGrandchildLevel` - Add items at depth 3
- `ObservableListRemoveRangeAtMultipleLevels` - Test RemoveRange at various depths

### Category 2: Nested Callback Propagation
- `NestedCallbackNodePathVerification` - Verify callback node paths at different levels
- `MultiLevelCallbackOrdering` - Verify callback ordering when changes occur at multiple levels simultaneously

### Category 3: Expansion State Coordination
- `AddChildrenToExpandedNode` - Add children while parent is expanded
- `RemoveChildrenFromExpandedNode` - Remove children while parent is expanded
- `ClearChildrenOfExpandedNode` - Clear children while parent is expanded
- `ExpansionStatePersistsAcrossDynamicChanges` - Verify expansion state maintained during structure changes

### Category 4: Nested ObservableList Replacement
- `ReplaceChildrenAtLevel2` - Replace entire childrenProperty at grandchild level
- `ReplaceChildrenAtMultipleLevels` - Replace children at different levels in sequence

### Category 5: Parent Property Changes
- `ParentTextChangePreservesChildren` - Verify children unaffected by parent text changes
- `ParentPropertyChangeCallbackVerification` - Verify correct callbacks when parent properties change

### Category 6: Multi-Level UpdateBindingProperties
- `UpdateBindingPropertiesAffectsAllLevels` - Verify UpdateBindingProperties works at all tree depths
- `UpdateBindingPropertiesWithComplexHierarchy` - Test with 4+ level deep tree

## Design Considerations

### 1. Test Case Isolation
Each test case must create its own:
- `List<WString> callbackLog`
- `MockNodeProviderCallback nodeCallback(callbackLog)`

This ensures test isolation and prevents state pollution (critical lesson from Task No.5).

### 2. Helper Function Usage
Leverage existing helper functions:
- `InitProvider(provider)` - Sets textProperty and childrenProperty
- `CreateBindableTree(rootName, childCount)` - Creates root with N children

Create new helper for multi-level trees:
```cpp
auto CreateMultiLevelTree(const WString& rootName, vint level1Count, vint level2Count) -> Ptr<BindableItem>
{
    auto root = CreateBindableTree(rootName, level1Count);
    for (vint i = 0; i < level1Count; i++) {
        auto child = UnboxValue<Ptr<BindableItem>>(BoxValue(root->children[i]));
        for (vint j = 0; j < level2Count; j++) {
            auto grandchild = Ptr(new BindableItem());
            grandchild->name = rootName + L".Child" + itow(i+1) + L".GrandChild" + itow(j+1);
            child->children.Add(grandchild);
        }
    }
    return root;
}
```

### 3. Callback Log Clearing Strategy
Clear callback logs after:
- `SetItemSource` (except when testing SetItemSource itself)
- Preparing children via `GetChildCount()` at any level

This isolates the actual test operation from setup callbacks.

### 4. Eager Preparation Expectations
All callback expectations must account for eager preparation:
- When adding to a grandchild's ObservableList: `newCount=1` (or actual count)
- When removing: `count=N` (actual before removal), `newCount=0` (or remaining count)
- Never expect `count=0` when children existed before the operation

### 5. Node Path in Callbacks
The MockNodeProviderCallback uses the node's text value to show which node the callback is for:
- Root level: `[ROOT]->OnBeforeItemModified(...)`
- Child level: `Root.Child1->OnBeforeItemModified(...)`
- Grandchild level: `Root.Child1.GrandChild1->OnBeforeItemModified(...)`

This helps verify that callbacks fire for the correct node in the hierarchy.

## Proposed Test Count

Based on the categories above, approximately 15-20 test cases should be added to comprehensively cover hierarchical binding scenarios. This builds upon the foundation established in Task No.6 and prepares for edge case testing in Task No.8.

## Implementation Approach

1. Add a helper function for creating multi-level tree structures
2. Implement Category 1 tests (multi-level modifications) - 5 test cases
3. Implement Category 2 tests (callback propagation) - 2 test cases
4. Implement Category 3 tests (expansion coordination) - 4 test cases
5. Implement Category 4 tests (nested replacement) - 2 test cases
6. Implement Category 5 tests (parent property changes) - 2 test cases
7. Implement Category 6 tests (multi-level UpdateBindingProperties) - 2 test cases

Each test case will follow the established pattern:
```cpp
TEST_CASE(L"TestName")
{
    List<WString> callbackLog;
    MockNodeProviderCallback nodeCallback(callbackLog);
    
    auto provider = Ptr(new TreeViewItemBindableRootProvider());
    InitProvider(provider);
    provider->AttachCallback(&nodeCallback);
    
    // Setup multi-level tree
    // Clear logs after setup
    // Perform test operation
    // Verify callbacks with expected array
    // Verify tree structure
}
```

## Quality Assurance

To ensure comprehensive coverage:
1. Each test case tests ONE specific hierarchical scenario
2. All tests account for eager child preparation
3. Callback node paths are verified
4. Tree structure is verified after operations
5. Test names clearly indicate what hierarchical scenario is being tested
6. Expected callback arrays show actual child counts, not zero
7. Tests use the minimal infrastructure approach (no complex assertion frameworks)
